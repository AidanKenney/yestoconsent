	<p>
	At YES! we are committed to providing high-quality, sex-positive, consent-based education to youth about every aspect of sexuality. Through our workshops, we expand participants' understanding of consent and provide them with tools to be more communicative, respectful, and safe. Our organization has changed a lot since the beginning, and has grown from an idea between friends to a functioning organization. We teach our workshops in public school classrooms, and work on other projects promoting sex positive education in order to reach as many people as possible, including a blog, social media and a YouTube channel.

			In June of 2015, Isy and Eve came home to Montclair after graduating from college and began to brainstorm how they could best use their acquired knowledge and skills to contribute to their community. They decided they wanted to offer consent workshops to Montclair High School students because neither were satisfied withÂ the information on consent they were given at that age. With the help of Natalie and Rebecca, this idea became an organization.
