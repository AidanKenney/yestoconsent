	<h3>Who We Are</h3>

		<h4>We knew sexuality education was lacking. In 2015, we decided to do something about it.</h4>

<p>
	At YES! we are committed to providing high-quality, sex-positive, consent-based education to youth about every aspect of sexuality. Through our workshops, we expand participants' understanding of sexuality and provide them with tools to be more communicative, respectful, and safe.
</p>
<p>
	We teach our workshops in a variety of settings, including public school, private schools, and churches with children and adults of all ages. In addition to teaching, we promote sex positive education through our blog, social media, and YouTube channel.
