	<h2>Who We Are</h2>

		<h5>We knew sexuality education was lacking. In 2015, we decided to do something about it.</h5>
<p>
	YES! is committed to providing comprehensive sexuality education to people of all ages. Through our workshops, we expand participants' understanding of consent and provide them with tools to be more communicative, respectful, and safe. We teach our workshops in public school classrooms, and work on other projects promoting sex positive education in order to reach as many people as possible, including a blog, social media and a YouTube channel.</p>

<p>
	Our organization has changed a lot since the beginning, and has grown from an idea between friends to a functioning organization. In June of 2015, Isy Abraham-Raveson and Eve Gutman came home to Montclair after graduating from college and began to brainstorm how they could best use their acquired knowledge and skills to contribute to their community. They decided they wanted to offer consent workshops to Montclair High School students because neither were satisfied with the information on consent they were given at that age. With the help of Rebecca Klein and Natalie Smyth, this idea became an organization.
